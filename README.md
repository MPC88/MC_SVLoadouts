Notes / Warnings  
================  
Limited testing.
  
You will get one UGLY noise when you load a loadout.  More a warning for headphones users, but turn your speakers down just incase...  
  
Always backup your save game before installing any mod.  
  
If you encounter any bug when you have a mode loaded, uninstall the mod first.  If you can replicate the issue without any mods installed, then consider reporting it on official discord / forums.
